Analyzing Kickstarter data trends

Overview:
The purpose of the project is to learn the basics of Excel and to be able to comb through and organize data, while being able to convert elements of the data into visual datasets such as graphs/ pivot tables. We would be able to use a variety of functions built into Excel and understand how to extract specific columns and see the correlation between different groups of data.

Analysis and Challenges:
	Some difficulties that I came across while going through the deliverables would be understanding some of the fields required to put in the formula. Some of the formulas had similar names, such as COUNTIF() and COUNTIFS(). Another challenge would be some of the simple mistakes that I made, such as misanalysing certain rows and having to apply the fix to all the rows that I had already created. I either recreated the dataset once more or just used the find and replace feature within Excel.

Results:
Within the Theater Outcomes it would be best to release something within June, as that month has the highest success rate within the graph. Furthermore, the worse month to release something would be at the end of the year in December, as the rates for both success and failure are virtually the same at that point. In terms of the Outcomes Based on Goals, the worst outcomes would be towards the end of the year, as it had the highest chance of failure. The best time would be the beginning of the year, as they hit the highest number of successes. The dataset itself also poses some limitations, as the dataset itself is relatively old, with a majority of the years being taken four years or earlier. This indicates that the data itself may not be as reliable as a survey being taken today, for example. There are many other graphs and visuals that could also be added in addition, an example being a comparison of both the category statistics and subcategory statistics and see the differences between the general/ more specific.
